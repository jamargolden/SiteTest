**Description:**

This is a project based around a local trucking company called D&R Freight LLP where I took it upon myself to recreate the website while adding my own creative touch and improvements to help modernize the website and make it more visually appealing. The overall structure of the website is still very similar to the original with but now includes various animations, motion graphics, and videos that help to improve the overall message and feel of this businessâ€™s website. All animations were created by me using applications from the Adobe Creative Cloud Suite.

**Problems During Production:**

****During this project one of the main issues that I ran into was getting the video hero to display properly specifically on mobile. This while a simple issue was new to me being the first time I worked with video alongside React and during my testing I found that on IOS I was running into issues getting the hero to show properly even though it was fine on Desktop and Android. This was good practice for me to get used to developing for multiple platforms and learning to adapt to each device's quirks. The solution had to do with how IOS handles videos while in low power mode. On top of that I learned more about optimizing my media to help improve speed on less powerful machines.
